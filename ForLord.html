    <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>hank you Lord for all the blessings that I am receiving everyday. I am so grateful for everything. Even the laptop that is used in creating this Letter for you, I am so thankful. I am also grateful for your Love, Lord. Without your love, I cannot do these things and I am nothing without you, Lord. I am thankful that I am studying in a prestige school like DLSU. I cannot believe that I will study here. Your plans are indeed awesome, extraordinary, and it never failed me. I am also thankful that I have good friends, parents, and colleagues. Thank you Lord. I am sorry Lord for all the things that I have done. Please Lord, send your Holy Spirit to guide me. I also promise Lord that I will share your word. Please guide me in this plan Lord. Lord, I am also praying that guide me. Please guide me to reach my dreams. I want these dreams to become a reality. I will do everything to make it real. Still, your plans ang masusunod. I know that it will never fail me. Pinepray ko rin yung crush ko HAHAHAHAHA. I am also praying for my parents that you guide them Lord. I am also praying for this country and for the whole world. Thank you Lord. You are an awesome God. I love you. </p>
